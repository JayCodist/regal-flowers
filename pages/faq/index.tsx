                availability.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you prefer, you can also provide a representative in Lagos or
                Abuja that we can deliver to, or you can engage a flight courier
                at the airport (we can introduce you to one) who would help fly
                the items to other states in Nigeria.

              <p className="margin-bottom">
                When our delivery partners (typically Uber and other 3rd party
                delivery agents), get to the destination, they usually need to
                communicate with the recipient to collect the flowers and gifts,
                or to confirm who the recipient would prefer the driver drop the
                items with.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, as a security precaution many offices and
                residences usually request that the driver put a call through to
                the recipient before accepting the flowers and gifts. Finally,
                there are sometimes issues with locating the given address and
                the driver sometimes needs to communicate with the recipient to
                clarify how to get to the address to complete the delivery.
              </p>
              <p className="title small bold vertical-margin">
                Who do you deliver the items to?
              </p>
              <p>
                Our flower delivery in Lagos, Nigeria and Abuja, Nigeria is
                typically delivered directly to the intended recipient. However,
                if they are unavailable for any reason (meeting, phone off, not
                picking their calls etc), or if they request we do so, we would
                deliver to their receptionist, security guard, household staff,
                friend or colleague at the delivery point.
              </p>
              <p className="title small bold vertical-margin">
                What happens if the recipient doesn't pickup their phone, and
                there is no one to drop the flowers with at the destination?
              </p>
              <p>
                We usually at this point communicate with the sender on phone to
                give an update on the situation. In the event the sender is also
                unreachable for any reason, we would be forced to return the
                items to our flower shop in Lagos, Nigeria, and Abuja, Nigeria
                and the sender would then be required to pick them up, or pay
                another delivery fee.
              </p>
              <p className="vertical-margin">
                Due to the fact that our delivery partners are not able to wait
                at the destination for an email response, we usually return the
                flowers and gifts to our flower shop in Lagos, Nigeria and
                Abuja, Nigeria if the mode of communication with the sender was
                by email.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to the perishable nature of flowers and some gifts (cakes,
                cupcakes), items returned to our flower shop in Lagos, Nigeria
                and Abuja, Nigeria would be held for a limited amount of time
                and might eventually wither at the buyers expense.
