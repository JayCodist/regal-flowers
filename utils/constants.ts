      "Warning: This is not a typical About Us story, because you see, Regal Flowers started in an unusual way. It was a Sunday morning, the year was 2016, in the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria, and our founder, reeling from the very recent heartbreak of his relationship (Hint: She left him) was determined to get his girlfriend back.  She was traveling to Abuja, Nigeria that afternoon, and he wanted to get beautiful flowers for her so he decided to check online for flower shops in Lagos or Abuja that could deliver a bouquet of red roses and chocolates to her the same day. He searched high and low, and while he found other online flower delivery shops in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria, he couldn’t find one that ticked all the right boxes.  The flower shops he found either didn’t look reputable enough (after all he was already heartbroken, he couldn’t afford to lose his money too, and this is Nigeria, where you have to be vigilant), or were out of stock (even though they didn’t say so on their website until he called), or they didn’t have enough options for various budgets. He finally found one that claimed to be open 24 hours on their Google Maps, and when they didn’t pick up the phone, he drove down there, only to meet it closed. Ouch. No, he eventually didn’t get her back, and No, it wasn't because he couldn't send her the red roses and chocolates. Instead, it was, as the dictionary would say, irreconcilable differences, and they remain friends, but he instead gained the passion for flowers and gifts that would eventually see him open his own online and walk-in fresh flower shop in Lagos and Abuja An online flower shop that would precisely tick all the right boxes: "

      "It would be open 24 hours not only for online orders but also for walk-ins. We once had a client take us up on the offer by walking in by 3 am. He was on his way to pick up his wife at the airport and wanted to buy red roses to welcome her. He was shocked we were actually open. Regal Flowers and Gifts is also open every day of the year including weekends and public holidays (yes, Christmas, Easter, and New Year's Day too). We are badass like that ",
